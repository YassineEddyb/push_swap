# push_swap_42

push swap is a 42 project that allows you to learn about varouis sorting alghorithems.
the goal from this project is to sort a stack of numbers with the latest instructions possible, you only allowed to use tow stack stack a which contians random number without any dublicates

you only allowed to use the folowing actions:

sa : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there
is only one or no elements).
sb : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there
is only one or no elements).
ss : sa and sb at the same time.
pa : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do
nothing if b is empty.
pb : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do
nothing if a is empty.
ra : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes
the last one.
rb : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes
the last one.
rr : ra and rb at the same time.
rra : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element
becomes the first one.
rrb : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element
becomes the first one.
rrr : rra and rrb at the same time
